# Substring Search

# Task: Given the string s, use string methods to:
# Find the index of "fox": get the starting index of the substring "fox". If "fox" is not found, it should return -1.
# Count occurrences of "the": Use the string's built-in method to count how many times the substring "the" appears in the string.
s:str ="the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

print(s.find('fox1'))
print(s.find('fox'))
print(s.count('the'))
